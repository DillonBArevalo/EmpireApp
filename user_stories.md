* A user can be a DM for a party and allot skill points/equipment to characters within that party
* Use an interface that shows all their equipment (equipped or not) and allows them to equip/unequip and see dynamically updated stats
* Create a combat field (map)
* Use combat fields to engage in battles with characters
