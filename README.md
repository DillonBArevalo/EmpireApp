# Empire

This is a project for creating, updating, and hopefully, even running games with characters in the game EMPIRE, created by myself (Dillon Arevalo) and Jack Wostrel (currently in alpha). It is a tabletop game in the style of Dungeons and Dragons but with a much more deadly, tactical, and choice oriented flavor.

The app not yet live.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but recognize that the choices relevant to game mechanics are part of an entirely different type of discussion. No proposed changes that modify the expression of the game mechanics will be accepted without revision.
Beyond that, feel free to fork the repository and make whatever changes or additions you like! Make a pull request and I'll review it at my earliest convenience. Be sure to provide or update testing as appropriate for new features or edits!
If your new content fails any tests it will not be accepted. If your content does not include tests it is less likely to be accepted (depending on what it is)
